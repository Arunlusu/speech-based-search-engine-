## üß† **Purpose**:

To listen to your voice input, recognize your speech, and then search the spoken query on Google using your default web browser.

## üì¶ **Key Libraries Used**:

* `speech_recognition`: For capturing and converting speech to text.
* `pyttsx3`: For text-to-speech (TTS) to give audio responses.
* `webbrowser`: To open URLs in the browser.

## üîß **How It Works**:

1. **Speech Prompt**:

   * Uses `pyttsx3` to ask: *‚ÄúWhat do you want to search for?‚Äù*

2. **Listening and Recognition**:

   * Records your voice using your microphone.
   * Converts the speech to text using Google's Speech Recognition API.

3. **Web Search**:

   * If speech is successfully recognized, constructs a Google search URL.
   * Opens the search in the default browser.
   * Uses TTS to confirm: *‚ÄúHere are the search results for‚Ä¶‚Äù*

4. **Error Handling**:

   * Handles unrecognized speech (`UnknownValueError`).
   * Handles issues with the recognition service (`RequestError`).

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Execution Flow**:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    query = take_command()
    search_web(query)
```

## üìù **Suggestions for Improvement**:

* Add support for multiple search engines (e.g., Bing, DuckDuckGo).
* Add a GUI or voice feedback confirming if the browser opened.
* Support more commands (e.g., "open YouTube", "search images of cats").
